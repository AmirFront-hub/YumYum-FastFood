my web development project, “Foodtruck: Yum yum gim me sum,” which showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This app simulates a food ordering experience, where users can browse a menu and select food items to add to their order. 
The main highlight of this project is the JavaScript functionality, where I implemented dynamic interactivity—enabling users to customize their orders, calculate totals, and interact with a responsive UI. 
This project demonstrates my ability to combine front-end technologies to create a fully functional and engaging user experience.
